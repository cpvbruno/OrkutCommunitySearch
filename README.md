# OrkutCommunitySearch
An application to search on Orkut Community Archive

How To

1 - Go to: http://orkut.google.com/

2 - Select one of the index letters, for an example, if you want to search for a community that starts with "A" click on "A"

3 - Copy the URL of the current page (ex: http://orkut.google.com/l-a.html)

4 - Open the Application and set the name parammeter for search

5 - Paste the URL

Results will show up soon, but be aware, depending of the what you type, could take a long time to search on each page and retrieve you the result.


The "name" field is case-sensetive.



Tips:
In the name of the community don't type complex words, try to be brief, the App will search for similar results.
Paste the link of the Orkut Community Archive page of the start letter you want, like if you want letter "A" community use:
http://orkut.google.com/l-a.html (orkut can change this link anytime)
